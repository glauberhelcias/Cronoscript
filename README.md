Webapp to set a series of countdowns

Allows you to set a series of countdowns following a script, eg 3 sets of 6 minutes with 2 minutes before every series. The app displays a countdown timer and counts 6 minutes followed by 2 minutes, each one in turn by three times. This can be done to a script with any number of timers.
